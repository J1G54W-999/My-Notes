- ### Creating archives with `tar`:
- `tar` (Tape Archive) â†’ For compressing, extracting, and archiving files and directories. Commonly used for backups and transferring large sets of files
- 
- `c` = create
- `v` = Verbose (show us what it's doing)
- `f` = Filename of the tar file has to come after this option (Must have a name)
- 
- Syntax: `tar [options] <New_file.tar> <target_file.txt>` 
- Example: `tar -cvf sample_tar_file.tar sample.txt` 
- 
- NOTE: The `-f` flag MUST be followed by the archive name, the order of the other flags doesn't matter  
- ### Creating Zip archives:
- 
- `z` = Creates a compressed zip file
- (sample in this case is a directory)
- Example: `tar -cvzf sample_tar_file.tar.gz sample` 
- 
- Use `file` to check if the created file is actually a zip and not an archive with double extensions
- Example: `file sample_tar_file.tar.gz` 
- 
- ### Unpacking Archives with `tar`:
- `x` = extract
- 
- Syntax: `tar [options] <target_file_to_unpack>` 
- `tar -xvf sample_tar_file.tar`
